Dear members, hello!
In order to welcome XRPP Ecosystem 2.0 and increase XRPP liquidity, the Global Community Governance Committee has made the following decision after research: All unreleased contracts of the Project will be released at 00:01 GMT on October 28, 2024, and the withdrawable XRPP will be automatically transferred to the corresponding address through the contract (after all are released, you don’t need to withdraw them yourself, you can withdraw them freely during the period, and if you don’t withdraw them, they will all be transferred to your wallet address with the contract). The Project contract will retain the data until the end of the month for everyone to check and reconcile.

XRPP Ecosystem 2.0 has been officially launched, and multiple applications will be launched in the future. Please pay attention to the announcement for the specific launch time.
