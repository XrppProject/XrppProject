Abstract
The XRPP operation team is developing its own decentralized derivatives exchange, which will adopt the third-generation exchange model and support trading of multiple assets such as cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange, and US stocks. XRPP will serve as the platform currency of the exchange.

Main content:
* Third-generation exchange: Different from the centralized first-generation exchanges (such as Binance, Coinbase) and the decentralized second-generation exchanges dedicated to cryptocurrencies (such as Uniswap), the third-generation exchanges adopt a decentralized derivatives trading model and support multiple asset transactions.
* Exchange launch and functions: The exchange is scheduled to go online in mid-September, and will initially open cryptocurrency trading, information sharing functions, and XRPP-based financial management functions. Foreign exchange and US stock trading will be opened one after another.
* XRPP destruction and project changes: When the exchange goes online, all undestroyed XRPP will be destroyed, and the total circulation will be fixed at 300 million. At the same time, new member registration and investment will be stopped. The 3x income of existing members will remain unchanged, and they can also participate in the exchange's coin mining section.
